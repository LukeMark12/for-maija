          Dear Maija,

I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s already been 37 days since we began this journey together. Even though weâ€™re apart, youâ€™re always close to my heart. Tomorrow is National Girlfriend Day, and I want you to know how much you mean to me. Your kindness and the love you share make everything worth it, even from a distance. Iâ€™m so grateful to have you in my life. Happy National Girlfriend Day, Maija.
